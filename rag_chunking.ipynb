They were descended from Norse (\"Norman\" comes from \"Norseman\") raiders and pirates from Denmark, Iceland and Norway who, under their leader Rollo, agreed to swear fealty to King Charles III of West Francia. Through generations of intermarriage with the local Frankish, Breton, and Gallo-Roman populations, their descendants were assimilated into the culture, and they ultimately adopted the Gallo-Romance language as their mother tongue.\n",
